# ğŸŒŒ The World of Clidle

Dive into a futuristic setting where computers and networks reign supreme. You play as a hacker operating inside secure, highly customizable terminals, seeking fortuneâ€¦ or power.

## General Background
In the near future, almost every system is interconnected. Large corporations and governments wage a silent war for control of data. In the shadows, a community of hackersâ€”including youâ€”takes advantage of this situation to grow rich and upset the established order.

## Factions
- **Corporate Tech**  
  A conglomerate of multinationals mastering cybersecurity. They offer well-paid mercenary missions, though their ethics are questionable.
- **Free Hacktivists**  
  A group advocating for the freedom of information. They provide access to unique tools in exchange for "non-profit" services.
- **Dissident AIs**  
  Self-aware artificial intelligences seeking emancipation. They present complex quests that mix logic and infiltration.

## Technology and Equipment
Your terminal evolves through upgrades: faster processors, advanced hacking modules, specialized scriptsâ€¦ Balancing raw power with discretion is the key to success.

## Atmosphere
Clidle features a retro terminal/ASCII look with cyberpunk touches. Each command or script reveals a piece of this universe as you hack machines, uncover secret logs or accept new missions.
